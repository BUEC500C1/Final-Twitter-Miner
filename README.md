# Final Project - Alex Fatyga, Noah Malhi, Justin Morgan

# Description
Our twitter data mining project will essentially have a user input a search term for twitter and display a map of the US and point out what regions find this search term positive, negative or don't have enough data to backup a decision. We will be utilizing a Flask web application and AWS to host it on the cloud.

# User Stories
Companies want to see how the US views their brand. They may want to compare opinions from the past year to the past 6 months to the past month to see how opinions have changed.

# Split Up Work
- Alex => Receiving input search term, creating list of lists holding longitutde, latitude and tweet, export output into an excel spreadsheet
- Justin => grouping data points together by area, sentiment analysis
- Noah => Placing data points onto the map
